 Let's say we have some heavy tasks we want to complete, we are going to represent it by to different functions mutating a value.

 Calling connect is a way to make sure everything that should be listening to the multicast is already set up.

 Which is not our case here :

 Let's say give it a CurrentValueSubject instead how will it impact our publisher?

/*:
 Using a CurrentValueSubject means there is a buffer for the last event and it must have an initial value, here we give it an instance of `Void`.
 This means when connecting using `then` we will immediatly receive a `Void` event which will trigger the first and second operation and once both completed the end.
 But this does not include the event sent when `deferredBegin` is executed, which trigger a new event from the multicast.

 Now there is also a way to create a multicast where all subscribers receive a different subject, but we will ignore this one ðŸ™ˆ.
 We might get back to it once we understand the inside and out of the `Subscriber`protocol.

 But let's look at this `connect` functionality, this seems like something that could be usefull not only to multicast.
